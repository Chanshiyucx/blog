Hallo, I am currently enrolled in the A1.1 German course and have been enjoying the learning experience. As the course is coming to an end, I am considering my next steps for continuing my German studies.

Over the past few weeks, I have also been studying on my own and would like to accelerate my progress. I am wondering whether it would be possible to skip the A1.2 course and move directly to the A2 course. If necessary, I am willing to purchase the A1.2 textbook and study the material independently to ensure I cover the required content.

Could you please advise me on whether this option is feasible?

Looking forward to your response.
