> Could you give me an overview of your work experience?

Of course. I'm a Full-Stack Developer with over 8 years of experience, specializing in building scalable and high-performance web applications, with a strong focus on the frontend.

My career began at Jinji Network Technology, where I built a solid foundation in frontend development using React and also gained my first experience in cross-platform mobile development with React Native.

From there, I moved to Blitz Interactive Entertainment, where I took on more end-to-end responsibilities. A key project was building a proprietary instant messaging system from scratch. This was where I deepened my backend skills with Spring Boot and learned to manage the entire application lifecycle using Docker.

In my most recent role as a Senior Frontend Developer at Toyou Feiji, I shifted into a leadership position. I led the technical architecture for a major platform redesign using Vue.js and TypeScript, which significantly improved maintainability. I also focused heavily on optimizing the developer workflow—for instance, by migrating to Vite to achieve over 60% faster build times—and I had the opportunity to mentor three junior developers.

Now, I've moved to Germany to seek a new challenge in a more advanced tech environment. I'm looking for a dedicated frontend role where I can apply my deep experience with frameworks like Vue.js and React, and my passion for performance optimization. Your company's work really resonates with me, and I'm very excited about the possibility of contributing to your team.

> What were your key contributions at Toyou Feiji?  
> What kind of projects did you mainly work on in your last role?  

Sure. For the past two years at Toyou Feiji, I worked as a Senior Frontend Developer with full-stack responsibilities. My main focus was on improving the performance, architecture, and overall developer experience for our storage management platforms. I'd say my key contributions fall into three main areas.

First, my primary project was leading the architectural redesign of our centralized storage platform. The old system was legacy code, making it really difficult to maintain and scale. So, I led the design of a completely new frontend architecture using Vue.js and TypeScript. This created a much more scalable, component-based system. As a result, our codebase became type-safe and significantly easier to work with, which really boosted the team's development speed.

Next, on our distributed storage platform, I focused on optimizing the developer workflow. The team was struggling with long build times, which was a real drag on productivity. I drove the migration from Webpack to Vite, and integrated ESLint into our CI/CD pipeline. The results were immediate: we cut our build times by over 60%, and the ESLint integration automatically caught and helped us fix over 300 legacy issues, which drastically improved our code quality.

And third, beyond the core platforms, I took the initiative to innovate. Our support team was overwhelmed with repetitive questions, so I designed and built an AI-powered chat tool using Vue.js and integrated it with a service called Ragflow. This tool successfully automated answers to common questions, which freed up our support team to focus on more complex cases.

Finally, on top of all that, a key part of my role was mentoring. I was formally responsible for three junior developers, guiding their technical growth and leading our code review process to build a strong culture of quality.

> What were your key contributions at Blitz Interactive?

Yes, absolutely. My time at Blitz Interactive was a period of huge growth for me. I joined as a Junior Frontend Developer, but I quickly took on a lot of responsibility.

My main achievement there was building the company's entire instant messaging system from the ground up. This was a critical feature for our company portal to handle real-time business inquiries. Although my title was on the frontend, I really took ownership of the whole project. This meant I not only built the chat interface in the frontend, but I also participated in maintaining the backend system and developed new features and requirements. I also containerized the whole system using Docker for deployment. It was a great full-stack experience.

Beyond that core project, I also developed the company's official website, which was crucial for our external presence and client engagement.

Alongside that, I also worked on improving our internal tools. For example, I built a reusable component library with over 20 components, which helped speed up development for the whole team.

So, my time at Blitz was really about that transition from being a junior developer to becoming an engineer who could own a complex project from end to end.

> What were your key contributions at Jinji Network Technology?

And earlier in my career at Jinji Network Technology, I focused on React Native and React projects, such as building a cross-platform mobile app and an admin frontend with file upload and data visualization.

Overall, my projects gave me strong experience in building scalable frontend systems, improving performance, and collaborating across full-stack teams.

## Clean Code Standards

### Question

- Can you give an example of how you've applied these standards in a past project?

### Answer

Sure. For example, in a management dashboard project, I worked on a file upload page where users often needed to upload very large files.

To improve performance and user experience, I optimized the upload component by implementing file chunking and batch uploading. This way, the files were uploaded in smaller parts simultaneously, which significantly reduced the waiting time.

At the same time, I kept the code modular and easy to maintain, so other developers could quickly understand and extend the component if needed. As a result, the upload process became much faster and smoother, and the feedback from both the team and users was very positive.

## Vue or React

### Question

- Since your resume highlights strong experience with both React and Vue.js, could you share an example of when you chose one framework over the other for a specific project, and what factors influenced your decision?

### Answer

Thank you—I'm glad you found them impressive! For instance, in my role at Toyou Feiji Electronics, I chose Vue.js for the storage management platform redesign because of its lightweight nature and excellent reactivity system, which suited our need for rapid prototyping and seamless state management in a complex UI. In contrast, at Jinji Network Technology, I opted for React when building the admin frontend and React Native app, as it offered better ecosystem support for mobile cross-platform development and integrated well with libraries like Ant Design for data visualization. The decision often boils down to project scale, team familiarity, and performance requirements.

## Backend Experience

### Question

- Could you tell me about your backend experience, particularly with Spring Boot? What kind of backend systems have you built or worked with?

### Answer

While my primary expertise is frontend development, I do have hands-on backend experience, particularly with Spring Boot.

At Blitz Interactive Entertainment, I built a complete messaging system using Spring Boot. This involved developing RESTful APIs, implementing real-time communication features, and creating an analytics dashboard. I handled everything from database design with MySQL to deployment using Docker.

More recently at Toyou Feiji Electronics, I joined the backend team to refactor APIs. During this project, I used Python and Django to build Redfish-compliant APIs for storage device management, and I successfully refactored over 100 interfaces.

## Problem-Solving and Technical Challenges

### Question

- Can you walk me through a particularly challenging technical problem you encountered in one of your projects? How did you approach solving it, and what was the outcome?

### Answer

At Toyou Feiji Electronics, our storage management platform had a critical performance issue. Our project is based on vue2, as the codebase grew, the Webpack build process was taking over 10 minutes, which was severely impacting our team's productivity.

My task was to find a solution that would significantly improve build performance without disrupting our existing codebase or introducing bugs.

I researched various approaches and proposed migrating from Webpack to Vite. However, this was complex because we were using Vue 2, and Vite primarily supports Vue 3. I had to carefully plan the migration, configure compatibility plugins, update our build configuration, and coordinate extensive testing with our QA team to ensure stability.

The result was impressive - we reduced build times from 9 minutes to under 3 minutes, a 60% improvement. More importantly, this taught me the value of thorough planning when upgrading core infrastructure and the importance of close collaboration with testing teams.
