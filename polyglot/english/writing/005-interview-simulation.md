## Introduction: Professional Background

### Question

Hello Xin, it's great to meet you! I've reviewed your resume, and I'm impressed by your experience moving from China to Munich. Let's start with the basics to get to know you better. Tell me a bit about yourself and your professional journey so far.  

### Answer

Thank you for the warm welcome! I'm Xin Chen, a 31-year-old Full-Stack Developer originally from China, now living in Munich with an Opportunity Card work permit. I have over 8 years of experience in web development, starting as a Junior Frontend Developer and progressing to senior roles. My background includes building end-to-end applications using React, Vue.js, and Spring Boot, with a focus on performance optimization. Recently, I've been enhancing my German skills through intensive courses up to B1 level, and I'm excited about contributing to innovative projects in a German company.

## Recent Work Experience

### Question

That's a solid background, Xin—it's clear you've built up a lot of expertise over the years. Moving on, I notice your most recent role was as a Senior Frontend Developer at Toyou Feiji Electronics in China. Could you walk me through some of the key projects you led there and what you learned from them?

### Answer

Absolutely, I'd be happy to dive into that. At Toyou Feiji Electronics from August 2022 to October 2024, I led the redesign of our storage management platform using Vue.js and TypeScript, implementing a modern frontend-backend separation which improved efficiency. I also developed Redfish-compliant RESTful APIs and refactored over 100 interfaces for better cluster management. Another highlight was creating an AI chat tool integrated with Ragflow to boost customer support. Through these, I learned the importance of scalable architecture and team collaboration, especially while mentoring juniors and optimizing workflows—like migrating to Vite for 60% faster builds and integrating Tailwind CSS.

## Technical Expertise: Frontend Frameworks

### Question

Impressive work on those projects, Xin—it sounds like you really drove some meaningful improvements there. Since your resume highlights strong experience with both React and Vue.js, could you share an example of when you chose one framework over the other for a specific project, and what factors influenced your decision?

### Answer

Thank you—I'm glad you found them impressive! For instance, in my role at Toyou Feiji Electronics, I chose Vue.js for the storage management platform redesign because of its lightweight nature and excellent reactivity system, which suited our need for rapid prototyping and seamless state management in a complex UI. In contrast, at Jinji Network Technology, I opted for React when building the admin frontend and React Native app, as it offered better ecosystem support for mobile cross-platform development and integrated well with libraries like Ant Design for data visualization. The decision often boils down to project scale, team familiarity, and performance requirements.

## Backend Development and Full-Stack Capabilities

### Question

That's a great example of framework selection, Xin. I can see you have solid frontend expertise, but I also notice you mention full-stack responsibilities in your recent role. Since we're looking for someone who can work across the entire stack, could you tell me about your backend experience, particularly with Spring Boot? What kind of backend systems have you built or worked with?

### Answer

While my primary strength is frontend development, I do have hands-on backend experience, particularly with Spring Boot. At Blitz Interactive Entertainment, I built a complete instant messaging system from scratch using Spring Boot, which handled real-time communication, business inquiries, and feedback features. This included developing RESTful APIs, implementing WebSocket connections for real-time messaging, and creating an analytics dashboard to visualize session data. I also worked with MySQL for data persistence and containerized the entire system using Docker for scalable deployment. More recently at Toyou Feiji Electronics, I developed Redfish-compliant APIs for storage device management. I'm comfortable working with databases, API design, and server-side logic, though I'd say my backend skills are intermediate level compared to my advanced frontend expertise.

## Problem-Solving and Technical Challenges

### Question

That's really valuable full-stack experience, Xin. Now, every developer faces technical challenges that push them to grow. Can you walk me through a particularly challenging technical problem you encountered in one of your projects? How did you approach solving it, and what was the outcome?

### Answer

One of the most challenging problems I faced was at Toyou Feiji Electronics when we were experiencing severe performance issues with our storage management platform. The application was loading slowly, and users were experiencing timeouts when managing large storage clusters. I approached this systematically: first, I profiled the application and identified that our build process was taking over 10 minutes, and the frontend was making too many API calls. My solution involved migrating from Webpack to Vite, which reduced build times by over 60%, and I refactored the API layer to implement batch requests and caching strategies. I also optimized our Vue.js components by implementing lazy loading and virtual scrolling for large data sets. The outcome was dramatic - page load times improved from 8 seconds to under 2 seconds, and the overall user experience became much smoother. This experience taught me the importance of performance monitoring and taking a holistic approach to optimization across the entire stack.

1. 不是调用太多API，我们原先使用 webpack 进行项目构建，而是随着项目代码规模的扩大，webpack 构建速度慢的问题逐渐显现，每次构建都需要花费大量时间，体验不是很好。此时新兴工具 vite 的成熟和官方支持，我计划将 webpack 替换为 vite。在重构期间我们遇到了一些问题：1. 第一个问题是依赖库的兼容问题，当升级到 vite 时，一些构建依赖库也需要替换为 vite 生态中的方案 2. 构建脚本的重新编排 3. 新语法
