### Question

Hello Xin, it's great to meet you! I've reviewed your resume, and I'm impressed by your experience moving from China to Munich. Let's start with the basics to get to know you better. Tell me a bit about yourself and your professional journey so far.  

### Answer

Thank you for the warm welcome! I'm Xin Chen, a 31-year-old Full-Stack Developer originally from China, now living in Munich with an Opportunity Card work permit. I have over 8 years of experience in web development, starting as a Junior Frontend Developer and progressing to senior roles. My background includes building end-to-end applications using React, Vue.js, and Spring Boot, with a focus on performance optimization. Recently, I've been enhancing my German skills through intensive courses up to B1 level, and I'm excited about contributing to innovative projects in a German company.

## Recent Work Experience

### Question

That's a solid background, Xin—it's clear you've built up a lot of expertise over the years. Moving on, I notice your most recent role was as a Senior Frontend Developer at Toyou Feiji Electronics in China. Could you walk me through some of the key projects you led there and what you learned from them?

### Answer

Absolutely, I'd be happy to dive into that. At Toyou Feiji Electronics from August 2022 to October 2024, I led the redesign of our storage management platform using Vue.js and TypeScript, implementing a modern frontend-backend separation which improved efficiency. I also developed Redfish-compliant RESTful APIs and refactored over 100 interfaces for better cluster management. Another highlight was creating an AI chat tool integrated with Ragflow to boost customer support. Through these, I learned the importance of scalable architecture and team collaboration, especially while mentoring juniors and optimizing workflows—like migrating to Vite for 60% faster builds and integrating Tailwind CSS.

## Technical Expertise: Frontend Frameworks

### Question

Impressive work on those projects, Xin—it sounds like you really drove some meaningful improvements there. Since your resume highlights strong experience with both React and Vue.js, could you share an example of when you chose one framework over the other for a specific project, and what factors influenced your decision?

### Answer

Thank you—I'm glad you found them impressive! For instance, in my role at Toyou Feiji Electronics, I chose Vue.js for the storage management platform redesign because of its lightweight nature and excellent reactivity system, which suited our need for rapid prototyping and seamless state management in a complex UI. In contrast, at Jinji Network Technology, I opted for React when building the admin frontend and React Native app, as it offered better ecosystem support for mobile cross-platform development and integrated well with libraries like Ant Design for data visualization. The decision often boils down to project scale, team familiarity, and performance requirements.
