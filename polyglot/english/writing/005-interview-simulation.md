## Self Introduction

### Question

- Tell me a bit about yourself and your professional journey so far.  

### Answer

I'm Xin Chen, a Full-Stack Developer from China, now based in Munich with an Opportunity Card work permit.

I have over 8 years of experience in web development, mainly focusing on frontend with React, Vue.js, and TypeScript. Over the years, I grew from junior to senior roles, building scalable and performant web applications.

I also have hands-on experience with Spring Boot on the backend, which makes it easy for me to work closely with backend teams.

I'm currently advancing my German skills through intensive courses to B1 level, and I'm highly motivated to contribute to innovative projects in a German company where I can grow further as a web specialist.

I look forward to talking about how I can support your team.

## Reasons for Coming to Germany

### Question

- Why did you decide to come to Germany for work?

- What attracts you about working in the German tech industry?
- How do you see your career developing in Germany?
- What's your long-term plan in Germany?

### Answer

Germany has always appealed to me for several professional reasons. First, the German tech industry's reputation for engineering excellence and quality-focused development really resonates with my approach to software development. I appreciate the emphasis on building robust, well-architected solutions rather than rushing to market.

Additionally, Germany offers a unique combination of established enterprises and innovative startups, which means diverse project opportunities and the chance to work with cutting-edge technologies. The work-life balance culture here also allows for sustainable career growth.

From a personal development perspective, working in Germany challenges me to grow professionally in an international environment while contributing my unique perspective and experience to diverse teams.

## Reason for Application

Combined with the flexibility and Munich location, this feels like the ideal next step in my career.

I'd love to hear more about your current projects!

## Work Experience

### Question

- Can you walk me through your previous work experience?
- What kind of projects did you mainly work on in your last role?
- Which achievements or responsibilities are you most proud of in your past jobs?
- What were your key contributions as a Senior Frontend Developer at Toyou Feiji Electronics?  

### Answer

I worked as a Senior Frontend Developer with full-stack responsibilities at Toyou Feiji Electronics last two year. My main project was the redesign of a storage management platform. I led the frontend architecture with Vue.js and TypeScript, migrated the build system to Vite, which improved build times by over 60%, and introduced ESLint standards that resolved more than 300 code issues. I also designed an AI chat tool integrated with Ragflow to support customer service.

Before that, at Blitz Interactive, I built a proprietary instant messaging system with a Spring Boot backend and a chat interface with media support. I also containerized the system with Docker for scalability.

And earlier in my career at Jinji Network Technology, I focused on React Native and React projects, such as building a cross-platform mobile app and an admin frontend with file upload and data visualization.

Overall, my projects gave me strong experience in building scalable frontend systems, improving performance, and collaborating across full-stack teams.

## Clean Code Standards

### Question

- Can you give an example of how you've applied these standards in a past project?

### Answer

Sure. For example, in a management dashboard project, I worked on a file upload page where users often needed to upload very large files.

To improve performance and user experience, I optimized the upload component by implementing file chunking and batch uploading. This way, the files were uploaded in smaller parts simultaneously, which significantly reduced the waiting time.

At the same time, I kept the code modular and easy to maintain, so other developers could quickly understand and extend the component if needed. As a result, the upload process became much faster and smoother, and the feedback from both the team and users was very positive.

## Vue or React

### Question

- Since your resume highlights strong experience with both React and Vue.js, could you share an example of when you chose one framework over the other for a specific project, and what factors influenced your decision?

### Answer

Thank you—I'm glad you found them impressive! For instance, in my role at Toyou Feiji Electronics, I chose Vue.js for the storage management platform redesign because of its lightweight nature and excellent reactivity system, which suited our need for rapid prototyping and seamless state management in a complex UI. In contrast, at Jinji Network Technology, I opted for React when building the admin frontend and React Native app, as it offered better ecosystem support for mobile cross-platform development and integrated well with libraries like Ant Design for data visualization. The decision often boils down to project scale, team familiarity, and performance requirements.

## Backend Experience

### Question

- Could you tell me about your backend experience, particularly with Spring Boot? What kind of backend systems have you built or worked with?

### Answer

While my primary expertise is frontend development, I do have hands-on backend experience, particularly with Spring Boot.

At Blitz Interactive Entertainment, I built a complete messaging system using Spring Boot. This involved developing RESTful APIs, implementing real-time communication features, and creating an analytics dashboard. I handled everything from database design with MySQL to deployment using Docker.

More recently at Toyou Feiji Electronics, I joined the backend team to refactor APIs. During this project, I used Python and Django to build Redfish-compliant APIs for storage device management, and I successfully refactored over 100 interfaces.

## Problem-Solving and Technical Challenges

### Question

- Can you walk me through a particularly challenging technical problem you encountered in one of your projects? How did you approach solving it, and what was the outcome?

### Answer

At Toyou Feiji Electronics, our storage management platform had a critical performance issue. Our project is based on vue2, as the codebase grew, the Webpack build process was taking over 10 minutes, which was severely impacting our team's productivity.

My task was to find a solution that would significantly improve build performance without disrupting our existing codebase or introducing bugs.

I researched various approaches and proposed migrating from Webpack to Vite. However, this was complex because we were using Vue 2, and Vite primarily supports Vue 3. I had to carefully plan the migration, configure compatibility plugins, update our build configuration, and coordinate extensive testing with our QA team to ensure stability.

The result was impressive - we reduced build times from 9 minutes to under 3 minutes, a 60% improvement. More importantly, this taught me the value of thorough planning when upgrading core infrastructure and the importance of close collaboration with testing teams.

## English Level

### Question

- How would you describe your English skills?
- Are you comfortable working in English on a daily basis?

### Answer

I would describe my English as fluent at a professional level. I use it daily for technical communication, documentation, and meetings, so I feel confident working in English.

## German Level

### Question

- Are you learning German?
- What is your current level of German?
- Do you plan to improve your German skills while working here?

### Answer

Yes, I'm actively learning German. I've completed intensive courses up to B1 level and I'm continuing to improve. I want to keep improving my German to communicate more naturally with colleagues and clients.

## Available Date

### Question

- When would you be available to start?
- What is your earliest possible starting date?

### Answer

I am available to start immediately.

## Visa

### Question

- Do you already have a valid work permit for Germany, or would you need sponsorship?
- What is your current visa status?

### Answer

I already hold an Opportunity Card work permit, so I'm authorized to work in Germany without requiring sponsorship.

## Salary

### Question

- What are your salary expectations?
- Do you have a salary range in mind?

### Answer

Based on my experience and research of the Munich market, I would expect something in the €60,000 to €70,000 range, but I'm flexible depending on the overall package, growth opportunities, and specific responsibilities.
