## Introduction: Professional Background

### Question

Hello Xin, it's great to meet you! I've reviewed your resume, and I'm impressed by your experience moving from China to Munich. Let's start with the basics to get to know you better. Tell me a bit about yourself and your professional journey so far.  

### Answer

Thank you for the warm welcome! I'm Xin Chen, a Full-Stack Developer from China, now based in Munich with an Opportunity Card work permit.

I have over 8 years of experience in web development, mainly focusing on frontend with React, Vue.js, and TypeScript. Over the years, I grew from junior to senior roles, building scalable and performant web applications.

I also have hands-on experience with Spring Boot on the backend, which makes it easy for me to work closely with full-stack teams.

I'm currently advancing my German skills through intensive courses to B1 level, and I'm highly motivated to contribute to innovative projects [at 4Soft] / [in a German company] where I can grow further as a web specialist. I look forward to talking about how I can support your team.

## Reason for application

### Question

Direct inquiry:
- Why are you interested in 4Soft specifically?
- What attracts you to this Frontend Developer position?
- Why do you want to work for our company?

Indirect inquiry:
- What do you know about our company?
- How do you see yourself fitting into our team?
- What aspects of this role excite you most?

### Answer

I'm genuinely excited about [4Soft] for several reasons. First, your company's mission to ['combine innovation with quality'] and create ['solid and high-quality software solutions using innovative techniques and methods,'] as stated on your About Us page, really resonates with my approach to development.

## Recent Work Experience

### Question

That's a solid background, Xin—it's clear you've built up a lot of expertise over the years. Moving on, I notice your most recent role was as a Senior Frontend Developer at Toyou Feiji Electronics in China. Could you walk me through some of the key projects you led there and what you learned from them?

### Answer

Absolutely, I'd be happy to dive into that. At Toyou Feiji Electronics from August 2022 to October 2024, I led the redesign of our storage management platform using Vue.js and TypeScript, implementing a modern frontend-backend separation which improved efficiency. I also developed Redfish-compliant RESTful APIs and refactored over 100 interfaces for better cluster management. Another highlight was creating an AI chat tool integrated with Ragflow to boost customer support. Through these, I learned the importance of scalable architecture and team collaboration, especially while mentoring juniors and optimizing workflows—like migrating to Vite for 60% faster builds and integrating Tailwind CSS.

## Technical Expertise: Frontend Frameworks

### Question

Impressive work on those projects, Xin—it sounds like you really drove some meaningful improvements there. Since your resume highlights strong experience with both React and Vue.js, could you share an example of when you chose one framework over the other for a specific project, and what factors influenced your decision?

### Answer

Thank you—I'm glad you found them impressive! For instance, in my role at Toyou Feiji Electronics, I chose Vue.js for the storage management platform redesign because of its lightweight nature and excellent reactivity system, which suited our need for rapid prototyping and seamless state management in a complex UI. In contrast, at Jinji Network Technology, I opted for React when building the admin frontend and React Native app, as it offered better ecosystem support for mobile cross-platform development and integrated well with libraries like Ant Design for data visualization. The decision often boils down to project scale, team familiarity, and performance requirements.

## Backend Development and Full-Stack Capabilities

### Question

That's a great example of framework selection, Xin. I can see you have solid frontend expertise, but I also notice you mention full-stack responsibilities in your recent role. Since we're looking for someone who can work across the entire stack, could you tell me about your backend experience, particularly with Spring Boot? What kind of backend systems have you built or worked with?

### Answer

While my primary strength is frontend development, I do have hands-on backend experience, particularly with Spring Boot. At Blitz Interactive Entertainment, I built a complete instant messaging system from scratch using Spring Boot, which handled real-time communication, business inquiries, and feedback features. This included developing RESTful APIs, implementing WebSocket connections for real-time messaging, and creating an analytics dashboard to visualize session data. I also worked with MySQL for data persistence and containerized the entire system using Docker for scalable deployment. More recently at Toyou Feiji Electronics, I developed Redfish-compliant APIs for storage device management. I'm comfortable working with databases, API design, and server-side logic, though I'd say my backend skills are intermediate level compared to my advanced frontend expertise.

## Problem-Solving and Technical Challenges

### Question

That's really valuable full-stack experience, Xin. Now, every developer faces technical challenges that push them to grow. Can you walk me through a particularly challenging technical problem you encountered in one of your projects? How did you approach solving it, and what was the outcome?

### Answer

One of the most challenging problems I faced was at Toyou Feiji Electronics when our Vue 2 storage management platform was experiencing severe build performance issues.

As our codebase grew, the Webpack build process was taking over 10 minutes, severely impacting our development workflow. I proposed migrating to Vite to solve this, but it wasn't straightforward since Vite is designed for Vue 3 by default.

I had to tackle several technical challenges: first, configuring the @vitejs/plugin-vue2 to make Vue 2.7 compatible with Vite; second, replacing incompatible Webpack loaders with Vite plugins; and third, updating syntax differences like environment variables and import statements throughout the codebase. The most critical part was coordinating extensive stability testing with our QA team to ensure no regressions were introduced. After weeks of careful migration and testing, we achieved over 60% faster build times - from 9 minutes down to under 3 minutes. This experience taught me the importance of thorough planning when upgrading core infrastructure and the value of close collaboration with the testing team.
