> Tell me a little bit about your professional background.  
> Could you give me an overview of your work experience?

Of course. As a Full-Stack Developer with over 8 years of experience, I specialize in building scalable and high-performance web applications.

My career began at Jinji Network Technology, where I built a solid foundation in web development using React and also gained my first experience in cross-platform mobile development with React Native.

From there, I joined Blitz Interactive Entertainment, I took on more responsibility. A key project was building an instant messaging system. This was where I gained backend experience with Spring Boot.

In my most recent role at Toyou Feiji, a tech company specializing in storage solutions, I led the architecture redesign of our centralized storage management platform using Vue.js and TypeScript, which improved system scalability and maintainability. Additionally, I migrated our distributed storage platform from Webpack to Vite, achieving over 60% faster build times. I also actively mentored three junior developers in modern frontend practices.

Now, I've moved to Germany to seek a new challenge in a more advanced tech environment. I'm looking for a senior frontend role where I can apply my skills and experience. I'm very excited about the possibility of contributing to your team.

> What were your key contributions at Toyou Feiji?  

Sure. For the past two years at Toyou Feiji, I worked as a Senior Frontend Developer with full-stack responsibilities. My main focus was on improving the performance, architecture, and overall developer experience for our storage management platforms. My key contributions fall into three main areas.

First, my primary project was leading the architecture redesign of our centralized storage platform. The old system had no clear separation between frontend and backend, making it difficult to maintain. So, I led the design of a completely new frontend architecture using Vue.js and TypeScript. This created a much more scalable, component-based system. As a result, our codebase became type-safe and easier to work with, which really boosted the team's development speed.

Next, on our distributed storage platform, I focused on optimizing the developer workflow. The project had extremely slow build times, so I migrated from Webpack to Vite, and integrated ESLint. As a result, we achieved over 60% faster build times, and the ESLint integration helped us fix over 300 legacy issues, significantly improving our code quality.

And third, our support team was overwhelmed with repetitive questions, so I built an AI-powered chat tool using Vue.js with Ragflow. This tool automated responses to common questions and helped our support team focus on more complex cases.

Finally, I mentored three junior developers and established a standard code review process that significantly improved our team's code quality.

> What were your key contributions at Blitz Interactive?

Yes, absolutely. My time at Blitz Interactive was a period of huge growth for me. I joined as a Junior Frontend Developer, but I quickly took on a lot of responsibility.

My main achievement there was building the company's instant messaging system from the ground up. This was a critical feature for our company portal to handle real-time business inquiries. Although I worked as a frontend developer, I took ownership of the entire project. This meant I not only built the chat interface in the frontend, but also maintained the backend system and developed new features. I also deployed the whole system using Docker. It was an excellent full-stack learning experience.

Additionally, I also developed the company's official website, which was crucial for our external presence and client engagement.

Moreover, I also worked on improving our internal tools. For example, I built a reusable component library with over 20 components, which helped speed up development for the team.

So, my time at Blitz was really about that transition from being a junior developer to becoming an engineer.

> What were your key contributions at Jinji Network Technology?

Jinji Network was my first role after graduating, my work there was quite diverse, which was great for learning.

My primary project was developing a cross-platform mobile app using React Native. I worked on features for both Android and iOS, for example, building a video player. This gave me hands-on experience with the challenges of mobile development.

On the web side, I focused on building an admin dashboard with React and Ant Design. This was where I built up my skills in React, implementing features like file uploads and data visualizations. I also redesigned the company's official website to improve user experience.

So, my time at Jinji was all about learning and building. It boosted my passion for frontend development and prepared me for the more complex challenges I took on later in my career.

> Could you tell me about your backend experience, particularly with Spring Boot? What kind of backend systems have you built or worked with?

My main expertise is in frontend development, but I also have hands-on backend experience, especially with Spring Boot.

At Blitz Interactive Entertainment, I maintained the backend and developed new features for the instant messaging system using Spring Boot. This involved creating RESTful APIs and deploying it with Docker.

More recently at Toyou Feiji Electronics, I worked with the backend team to refactor APIs. I used Python and Django to build Redfish-compliant APIs for our centralized storage management platform, and successfully refactored over 100 interfaces.

> Can you share a particularly challenging technical problem you encountered in one of your projects?  
> How did you approach solving it, and what was the outcome?

At Toyou Feiji Electronics, our centralized storage management platform had a critical performance issue. Our project was based on Vue 2, as the codebase grew, the Webpack build process was taking over 10 minutes, which was severely impacting our team's productivity.

My task was to find a solution that would significantly improve build performance without disrupting our existing codebase or introducing bugs.

I researched various approaches and determined migrating from Webpack to Vite. However, this was complex because we were using Vue 2, and Vite primarily supports Vue 3. I had to carefully plan the migration, configure compatibility plugins, update our build configuration, and coordinate with our testing team to ensure stability.

As a result, we reduced build times from 10 minutes to under 4 minutes, over 60% faster then before. More importantly, this taught me the value of planning when upgrading core infrastructure and the importance of close collaboration with testing teams.
