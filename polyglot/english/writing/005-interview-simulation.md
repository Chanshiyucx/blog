## Self Introduction

### Question

Hello Xin, it's great to meet you! I've reviewed your resume, and I'm impressed by your experience moving from China to Munich. Let's start with the basics to get to know you better. Tell me a bit about yourself and your professional journey so far.  

### Answer

Thank you for the warm welcome! I'm Xin Chen, a Full-Stack Developer from China, now based in Munich with an Opportunity Card work permit.

I have over 8 years of experience in web development, mainly focusing on frontend with React, Vue.js, and TypeScript. Over the years, I grew from junior to senior roles, building scalable and performant web applications.

I also have hands-on experience with Spring Boot on the backend, which makes it easy for me to work closely with full-stack teams.

I'm currently advancing my German skills through intensive courses to B1 level, and I'm highly motivated to contribute to innovative projects [at 4Soft] / [in a German company] where I can grow further as a web specialist.

I look forward to talking about how I can support your team.

## Work Experience

### Question

- Can you walk me through your previous work experience?
- What kind of projects did you mainly work on in your last role?
- Which achievements or responsibilities are you most proud of in your past jobs?
- What were your key contributions as a Senior Frontend Developer at Toyou Feiji Electronics?  

### Answer

I worked as a Senior Frontend Developer with full-stack responsibilities at Toyou Feiji Electronics last two year. My main project was the redesign of a storage management platform. I led the frontend architecture with Vue.js and TypeScript, migrated the build system to Vite, which improved build times by over 60%, and introduced ESLint standards that resolved more than 300 code issues. I also designed an AI chat tool integrated with Ragflow to support customer service.

Before that, at Blitz Interactive, I built a proprietary instant messaging system with a Spring Boot backend and a chat interface with media support. I also containerized the system with Docker for scalability.

And earlier in my career at Jinji Network Technology, I focused on React Native and React projects, such as building a cross-platform mobile app and an admin frontend with file upload and data visualization.

Overall, my projects gave me strong experience in building scalable frontend systems, improving performance, and collaborating across full-stack teams.

## Example for clean code standards

### Question

Can you give an example of how you've applied these standards in a past project?

### Answer

Sure. For example, in a management dashboard project, I worked on a file upload page where users often needed to upload very large files.

To improve performance and user experience, I optimized the upload component by implementing file chunking and batch uploading. This way, the files were uploaded in smaller parts simultaneously, which significantly reduced the waiting time.

At the same time, I kept the code modular and easy to maintain, so other developers could quickly understand and extend the component if needed. As a result, the upload process became much faster and smoother, and the feedback from both the team and users was very positive.

## Example of choosing vue or react

### Question

Impressive work on those projects, Xin—it sounds like you really drove some meaningful improvements there. Since your resume highlights strong experience with both React and Vue.js, could you share an example of when you chose one framework over the other for a specific project, and what factors influenced your decision?

### Answer

Thank you—I'm glad you found them impressive! For instance, in my role at Toyou Feiji Electronics, I chose Vue.js for the storage management platform redesign because of its lightweight nature and excellent reactivity system, which suited our need for rapid prototyping and seamless state management in a complex UI. In contrast, at Jinji Network Technology, I opted for React when building the admin frontend and React Native app, as it offered better ecosystem support for mobile cross-platform development and integrated well with libraries like Ant Design for data visualization. The decision often boils down to project scale, team familiarity, and performance requirements.

## Backend Development and Full-Stack Capabilities

### Question

That's a great example of framework selection, Xin. I can see you have solid frontend expertise, but I also notice you mention full-stack responsibilities in your recent role. Since we're looking for someone who can work across the entire stack, could you tell me about your backend experience, particularly with Spring Boot? What kind of backend systems have you built or worked with?

### Answer

While my primary strength is frontend development, I do have hands-on backend experience, particularly with Spring Boot. At Blitz Interactive Entertainment, I built a complete instant messaging system from scratch using Spring Boot, which handled real-time communication, business inquiries, and feedback features. This included developing RESTful APIs, implementing WebSocket connections for real-time messaging, and creating an analytics dashboard to visualize session data. I also worked with MySQL for data persistence and containerized the entire system using Docker for scalable deployment. More recently at Toyou Feiji Electronics, I developed Redfish-compliant APIs for storage device management. I'm comfortable working with databases, API design, and server-side logic, though I'd say my backend skills are intermediate level compared to my advanced frontend expertise.

## Problem-Solving and Technical Challenges

### Question

That's really valuable full-stack experience, Xin. Now, every developer faces technical challenges that push them to grow. Can you walk me through a particularly challenging technical problem you encountered in one of your projects? How did you approach solving it, and what was the outcome?

### Answer

One of the most challenging problems I faced was at Toyou Feiji Electronics when our Vue 2 storage management platform was experiencing severe build performance issues.

As our codebase grew, the Webpack build process was taking over 10 minutes, severely impacting our development workflow. I proposed migrating to Vite to solve this, but it wasn't straightforward since Vite is designed for Vue 3 by default.

I had to tackle several technical challenges: first, configuring the @vitejs/plugin-vue2 to make Vue 2.7 compatible with Vite; second, replacing incompatible Webpack loaders with Vite plugins; and third, updating syntax differences like environment variables and import statements throughout the codebase. The most critical part was coordinating extensive stability testing with our QA team to ensure no regressions were introduced. After weeks of careful migration and testing, we achieved over 60% faster build times - from 9 minutes down to under 3 minutes. This experience taught me the importance of thorough planning when upgrading core infrastructure and the value of close collaboration with the testing team.

## English Level

### Question

- How would you describe your English skills?
- Are you comfortable working in English on a daily basis?

### Answer

- I would describe my English as fluent at a professional level. I use it daily for technical communication, documentation, and meetings, so I feel confident working in English.
- My English is at a B2 level. I can communicate fluently in professional settings, especially in technical discussions and teamwork.

## German Level

### Question

- Are you learning German?
- What is your current level of German?
- Do you plan to improve your German skills while working here?

### Answer

- Yes, I'm actively learning German. I've completed intensive courses up to B1 level and I'm continuing to improve. My goal is to reach a higher level so I can integrate better into daily life and the workplace.
- I'm currently at B1 level and attending intensive courses. While English is fine for work, I want to keep improving my German to communicate more naturally with colleagues and clients.
