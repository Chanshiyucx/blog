How many of your articles actually get read till the end? I found a simple test that changed mine forever — and it only takes a cup of coffee.

It's Monday morning. You're half-awake, clutching a steaming cup of coffee, scrolling through your feed between yawns and sips.

Would your latest article make you pause, smile, or nod along? Or would it make you sigh, skim, and scroll past?

If your writing can't win over a sleepy coffee drinker, it might be time to rethink your approach.

As a writer, you know the feeling.

You pour your heart into an article. Every word, every line feels like it matters. You hit publish with butterflies in your stomach, hoping it'll resonate, spark conversations, or at least land with the people it's meant for.

And sometimes — it doesn't.

It falls flat. The views trickle in, the engagement is low, and you're left wondering _what did I miss?_

I've been there. More times than I'd like to admit.

## After Writing, Editing Is the Real Work

Writing a great article is just the beginning — editing is where it truly comes to life.

And over time, I've found a simple little ritual that makes it easier and a lot more fun.

I call it **The Coffee Test**.

## How I Discovered The Coffee Test

A while ago, I was reading an article titled _[Why Short Blogging Wins the Internet](https://stories.byburk.net/why-short-blogging-wins-the-internet-af6affcad4da)_ by Burk.

It was full of good insights, but one line, in particular, grabbed my attention — something he calls _The Coffee Test_.

And as a hardcore coffee girlie, you can imagine my excitement!

Here's how it goes:

## The Coffee Test

_Would I enjoy reading this with a cup of coffee in hand, half-awake, and possibly cranky?_

- If the answer is _yes_ — publish it.
- If the answer is _"ugh, maybe later"_ — it needs a rewrite. Tighten it. Cut the fluff. Keep the fun.

Simple, honest, and surprisingly effective.

## Why It Works So Well

We usually edit in _writer mode_: overthinking, attached to our words, too precious about our paragraphs.

But most readers?

They're not in a workshop or retreat. They're in line at the coffee shop. They're scrolling at 7 AM. They're skimming between Zoom calls.

_The Coffee Test_ forces you to read like your audience.

- Would this sentence hold my attention if I were half-awake?
- Would I chuckle? Nod in agreement?
- Would I keep scrolling or pause to finish this?

If it can't pass the coffee test, it won't survive on the internet.

## How to Apply The Coffee Test to Your Writing

It's simple but requires honesty. Here's how you can turn this little mental trick into a regular part of your editing process:

1. **Finish Your First Draft** Write your article, caption, newsletter, or story as you normally would. Don't overthink it yet.
2. **Take a Short Break** Step away for a bit — five minutes, an hour, overnight if you can afford it. This isn't just about the literal coffee; it's about creating mental space.
3. **Read It as a Reader, Not a Writer** Now, imagine it's a random morning. You're slightly cranky. You've barely opened your eyes. The coffee hasn't kicked in yet. If your piece can survive _that_ mood and still make someone laugh, nod, or share it, you've nailed it.
4. **Be Ruthless with the Fluff** If a sentence makes you think "maybe later" — cut it. Rewrite it. Make it sharper, wittier, or more useful. Remove filler words and redundant ideas. Keep it lean and punchy.
5. **Keep the Fun** The goal isn't to make it formal or robotic. It's to keep the essence of _you_ in it but in a way that someone can enjoy with one eye open and a coffee in hand.

**I have recently published an article**, and I wanted to share an example of how applying the Coffee Test transformed the title and introduction to make it more engaging:

**Before The Coffee Test:**

_Why Introverts Should Try 30 Days Focus Era_

Many introverted writers find it hard to stay motivated because they often prefer solitude and quiet over social settings. By committing to 30 days of focused writing, introverts can build discipline and improve their ability to concentrate. This approach helps them avoid distractions and achieve steady progress in their writing goals.

**After The Coffee Test:**

_The 30-Day Focus Era That Will Transform Your Writing Journey as an Introvert_

**Stop procrastinating just because you're an introvert.**

There's something beautiful about finding a little corner of the internet where you can just be yourself — no filters, no pressure to impress, just words. For me, that space has been Medium.

## **Writing Is About Connection**

Great writing isn't just about beautiful words or perfect grammar. It's about connection.

It's about making someone pause their scroll, sip their coffee, and think, _"Okay, this is good."_

The Coffee Test has become my no-fuss, honest way of making sure my words land the way they should. It's a simple little ritual that quietly shapes how I edit.

So next time you wrap up a draft, pour yourself a cup, embrace your half-awake, mildly grumpy self, and ask:

_Would I actually read this right now?_

If the answer's yes — hit publish.

If not, you know what to do.

Remember, every writer struggles with editing — The Coffee Test is just one way to bring your words closer to your readers' hearts.
