## Self-Introduction

**Question:**

- Good morning, Mr. Chen. Welcome to our booth. Could you please briefly introduce yourself and tell us why you're interested in our company?

**Answer:**

- Good morning! Thank you very much. My name is Xin Chen, and I am a Frontend Developer with over 8 years of experience, particularly skilled in building web applications with React, Vue.js, and TypeScript. I have a proven track record in optimizing complex systems, UI implementation, and teamwork. I noticed your company's leading position in AI solutions and truly appreciate your philosophy regarding innovation. I am looking for new challenges in Germany and believe my skills and experience can bring significant value to your company.

## Work Experience

**Question:**

- **English:** Your resume states you were a Senior Frontend Developer at Toyou Feiji Electronics. Could you elaborate on the most challenging project you were responsible for there, especially regarding the development of Redfish-compliant RESTful APIs?

**Answer:**

- Certainly. At Toyou Feiji Electronics, I was primarily responsible for the complete overhaul of the storage management platform. A key challenge was developing Redfish-compliant RESTful APIs and refactoring over 100 existing interfaces to optimize storage device management for clusters. This not only involved understanding complex technical specifications but also close collaboration with the backend team to ensure smooth and efficient data flow between frontend and backend. Through this refactoring, we significantly improved the system's scalability and maintainability.

## Vue.js vs React

**Question:**

- I notice you have experience with both Vue.js and React. Which do you prefer and why?

**Answer:**

- Both frameworks have their strengths. Vue.js has a gentler learning curve with intuitive template syntax, making it great for rapid development. React has a richer ecosystem and a more pure component-based approach, excelling in large-scale projects. I've been using Vue.js more in recent projects, but I can flexibly choose based on project requirements. What's important is understanding their core concepts like virtual DOM, component lifecycle, and state management - these principles are universal.

## Technical Skills

**Question:**

- Your skills list mentions optimizing with Vite and ESLint, achieving over 60% faster build times. How did you accomplish this, and how do you ensure code quality and team collaboration in your projects?

**Answer:**

- Yes, we successfully reduced build times by over 60% by migrating our development environment from Webpack to Vite. Vite's fast cold start and on-demand compilation features were instrumental in this. Simultaneously, we introduced strict ESLint standards and fixed over 300 existing errors to ensure consistent code style and quality. To foster team collaboration and code quality, I also mentored three junior developers and established a mandatory code review process. This ensures that all code undergoes peer review, issues are identified promptly, and overall code quality is continuously improved.

## Motivation for Germany & Language

**Question:**

- You're currently learning German, and your resume mentions seeking new challenges in Germany. Besides language learning, what other aspects of working and living in Germany do you think you'll need to adapt to? What do you know about the IT industry in Germany?

**Answer:**

- Yes, I am actively learning German and have reached B1 level, currently attending an intensive course. Besides the language, I believe adapting to Germany's efficient, structured work approach and its culture of attention to detail and punctuality is very important. I've done some research on the German IT industry and understand that there's a high demand for innovation and engineering quality. I am very excited to become part of the German IT ecosystem and believe my technical background and quick learning ability will help me integrate smoothly.

## Teamwork & Communication

**Question:**

- Your resume states you established a code review process and mentored junior developers. How important do you consider effective communication and collaboration in a cross-cultural team? How do you ensure team members understand your technical decisions?

**Answer:**
	
- In my experience, especially in cross-cultural teams, effective communication and collaboration are the cornerstones of project success. I always strive to articulate technical concepts clearly and concisely, whether through verbal explanations, diagrams, or detailed documentation. In code reviews, I focus on providing constructive feedback and encourage two-way communication. When making important technical decisions, I explain the reasoning and potential implications behind them to ensure team members understand and agree, thereby building consensus and preventing misunderstandings. I also find that openly asking questions and actively listening are crucial for bridging cultural and technical understanding gaps.

## Expectations & Future

**Question:**

- What are your expectations for your future IT career in Germany? What kind of development do you hope to achieve in our company?

**Answer:**

- I hope to continue my professional growth in a dynamic company, participating in challenging projects. I look forward to continuously learning the latest frontend technologies, gaining deeper insights into best practices in the German IT industry, and collaborating with a strong team of engineers. I wish to work in an environment that values innovation, offers opportunities for learning and growth, and where I can ultimately contribute my experience and skills to help the company achieve its goals.

## Questions from Candidate

**Question:**

- Do you have any questions for us?

**Answerï¼š**

- Yes, I do have a few questions. First, what role does the frontend team typically play in your company's future product roadmap? Are there plans to introduce new tech stacks or delve deeper into specific areas? Second, what professional development and training opportunities does your company usually offer for frontend developers?
