I left at work at exactly five o’clock because I wanted to make it to the bank before it closed at 5:30. Fortunately, it’s on the way to the bus stop. I get to the bank and I stand in line. I fill out a deposit envelope and sign the back of my paycheck while I wait my turn. When I get to the front of the line, I hand the teller the envelope and I ask her if she could tell how much I had in my account. She told me my balance and handed me my receipt.

I ride the bus and the subway home. I realize that I need a few things at the market and stop at one on the way there. I pick up a cart as soon as I walk in and go to the produce department to load up on fruit, some apples and bananas. I look around to see what kind of cooked foods they have. I’m feeling lazy and I don’t want to cook tonight. I pick up a sandwich and I head for the checkout stands. I get into the shortest line and the cashier rings me up. She gives me my change and the bagger hands me my bags. I walk the two blocks to my apartment and I’m ready for a relaxing evening at home.
