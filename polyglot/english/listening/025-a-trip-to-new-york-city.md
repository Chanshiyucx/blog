Lucy: Hello.

Jeff: Hey, Lucy, it's Jeff.

Lucy: Hey, welcome back. How was your vacation?

Jeff: Oh, it was great. The seven days in New York were a blast.

Lucy: Oh, yeah? Did you do any sightseeing or just visit with friends?

Jeff: I got to do both, actually. First, I saw my friend Edmundo, who just moved there. He hadn't seen much of the city himself, so we went to all the tourist spots. We got a guidebook and went to the major museums, saw a play, went to a concert in Central Park, and took the Staten Island Ferry. We did all of that in a day and a half. It was a whirlwind, but we got to see a lot.

Lucy: A day and a half?! You guys must have been exhausted.

Jeff: Yeah, we were. But, the rest of my trip was pretty low-key. My friends Pat and Billie rented a car and we took a road trip to Upstate New York to visit some other friends of ours.

Lucy: Did you have to stay over in a hotel along the way, or did you drive straight through?

Jeff: We didn't bother with booking hotel rooms, so we just drove straight there. It wasn't that far.

Lucy: How long did you stay there?

Jeff: We were only there two days, and we drove back and got back last night. My flight was this morning at 8:00 a.m. The worst part of the whole trip was that my flight was cancelled. I was rebooked onto another flight that had a three hour layover in Chicago. That was a major pain.

Lucy: It sounds like it. Well, I'm glad you made it back okay. And you even have the weekend to rest up before work on Monday.

Jeff: Yeah, I'll need it. I've got to catch up on my sleep!
