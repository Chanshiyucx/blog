When I get home, I change into my casual clothes and head for the kitchen. I grab my sandwich, a napkin, and sit down at the dining room table to eat. For my birthday last year, my brother gave me some place mats that have maps of the United States on them. I have always been bad at geography so he thought he would be funny and give me something to study while I ate. Of course, I haven’t learned a thing! 

I am still hungry after the sandwich and want some dessert. I preheat the oven and then take a package of ready-made cookies out of the fridge that just needed to be baked. I get out a cookie sheet and put some aluminum foil on it. I always do this when I bake because this way, I don’t have to do any dishes afterwards. I could just throw away the foil. Then, I shape the dough into circles, put them on the cookie sheet, and put the pan into the oven. 

After 15 minutes, I put on my oven mitts and take the pan out. The cookies smell great, but first, I need to let them cool. After 30 minutes, I put three of them on a plate and the rest of them in a Tupperware container. I’ll take those to work tomorrow. That should make the day go by a little faster.
