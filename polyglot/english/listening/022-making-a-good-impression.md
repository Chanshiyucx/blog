My interview is today. It is with a large corporation with its headquarters in San Francisco, California. It also has satellite offices across the U.S. and in Europe. I'm not sure if this will be the right fit for me, but I'm keeping an open mind.

I got some sound advice from my aunt. She said I should be confident but not cocky. That means I have to look for opportunities to talk about myself but not make the mistake of boasting or, worse, making things up. I do that sometimes when I get really nervous. My brain stops working and my mouth keeps going.

I need to be respectful but not meek. I want to be professional with everyone – my co-workers and my bosses – but I don't want them to think that I would let my co-workers walk all over me.

I should show them that I'm a team player. Nobody likes a person who tries to grab the limelight all of the time, especially if they're new, like me.

Okay, I think I'm ready. I just have to remember to be confident, calm, respectful, professional, and a team player. No problem, right?
