I share a bathroom with my roommate, which is usually not a problem. We each try to keep the sink, the tub, and the toilet clean, and we have separate medicine cabinets to keep our things. There’s also room under the sink for our hairdryers and tampons.

I start out by rinsing my mouth with some mouthwash before flossing. Then, I take out my toothbrush and toothpaste and brush my teeth. I only wash my hair every other day so I put on a shower cap and don’t have to get out my shampoo and conditioner. I like to take bubble baths when I have time, but on a busy morning, a shower will have to do. I lather up quickly and give my legs a quick shave. 

I don’t wear a lot of make-up to work so I just put on a little blush and a light-colored lipstick, and skip the mascara and eye shadow. I put a few hot curlers in my hair and I’m ready for breakfast!
