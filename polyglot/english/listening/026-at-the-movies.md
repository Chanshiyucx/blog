My friend Jim and I decided to see the latest blockbuster this weekend. I like a good action movie once in a while. We decided to meet at the movie theater after work.

When I got to the theater, I looked around and didn't see Jim. So, I thought I would get in line to buy tickets. There were two different lines, so I asked a woman standing in the first one, "Is this the line for Mission Impossible 4?" She said, "Yes, I'm afraid it is." I turned around and saw why she said that. The line was really long and had about 20 people in it already. Oh, well. I went to the back of the line and waited.

About 10 minutes later, I saw Jim coming up the escalator. When he got off the escalator, he looked out of breath. He said, "Hey, sorry for being so late. I hit a lot of traffic on the way over." I told him, "Don't worry about it. As you can see, we have a long wait."

We finally got to the head of the line and walked up to the ticket window. The clerk behind the ticket window asked, "Can I help you?" I said, "Two tickets for MI-4, please." We weren't children, students, or seniors, so there were no special discounts for us. The clerk handed me two tickets and we headed inside. There was a ticket taker just inside the door. He took our tickets and handed back our stubs.

Coming straight from work, I was really hungry. Jim and I went to the concession stand and got a couple of Cokes, hot dogs, a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy. We were set. We went into the screening room and it was packed. Luckily for us, we found some seats together that weren't too close to the screen.

We sat back and waited for the movie to start. While we watched 10 minutes of previews, we wolfed down our food. By the time the movie started, I was feeling pretty good. I don't know which was better, the movie or the great junk food!
