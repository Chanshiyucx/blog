I told myself I'd take the afternoon off.

I'd done enough that day. Woke up early. Published a post. Replied to emails. Even cleaned the bathroom floor of the hotel room I was staying in. So I shut the laptop. Made coffee. Sat on the edge of the bed and tried to breathe slower.

But then I opened the laptop again. Not to work, exactly. Just to check views. To "make sure nothing urgent had come in."

Twenty minutes later, I was halfway through editing a draft that wasn't due for another week.

I didn't even notice myself doing it.

Resting feels like something I have to sneak in around the edges of productivity. Like it only counts if it's earned.

And even when I try, I can't relax properly. My brain keeps score and I think about what I _should_ be doing. What someone else might be getting done while I sit here. What I'll have to catch up on tomorrow.

It doesn't matter how tired I am. Nor does it matter how early I started. If I'm not actively working toward something, I feel like I'm wasting time.

I don't remember ever being taught how to rest.

What I do remember is being called lazy.

At school, I was the kid who needed extra time. The one who dropped things. Took longer. Finished last. But instead of support for my [dyspraxia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/developmental-coordination-disorder-dyspraxia-in-adults/#:~:text=Dyspraxia,%20also%20known%20as%20developmental,learning%20to%20drive%20a%20car.), I got warnings.

"Try harder."

"Stop making excuses."

"You're smart, you just don't apply yourself."

So I learned to look busy.

Even if I didn't understand the homework, I'd still hand something in. Skipped lunch. Stayed up late. All to avoid the way teachers looked at me with sheer disappointment when I asked for help.

If I wasn't doing something productive, I felt like I was failing.

I used to think this pressure was just a me problem. That I was the only person who felt guilty for resting. Who kept refreshing emails just to feel in control. But I've been a self-employed writer for seven years now.

And I know I'm not the only one.

"People who work for themselves can be prone to long hours, lax boundaries around work-life balance and a nagging feeling that they're never quite doing enough," per the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/worklife/article/20230614-the-quiet-guilt-of-self-employment). "Overwork and subsequent burnout for the self-employed can be hugely problematic."

Many self-employed people (like myself) reward [productivity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephliu/2018/10/15/productive-mindset-self-employed/). We celebrate people who work through weekends, who answer emails on vacation, and who never turn off. We call it commitment. But most of the time, it's survival. And over time, that pressure stops feeling like a system we live in.

It starts feeling like who we are.

I've been trying to unlearn it. To rest without checking how many hours I've worked. To stop justifying time off like it needs approval.

Some days, I pull it off. I read a book in the middle of the day. I sit in a café with my phone on airplane mode. And I tell myself I'm allowed. But even then, part of me keeps score because it feels like I'm doing something wrong and hoping no one notices. Like I'm breaking a rule that everyone else still follows.

So lately I've been reading about people who are stepping out of that mindset. [Tricia Hersey](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1127470930), a New York Times Bestselling author, calls rest a form of resistance. Not laziness. Not indulgence. A refusal to let productivity define our worth.

"Take it slow," she said during an interview with [NPR](http://npr.org/transcripts/1127470930). "I love meditation. I love deep breathing, taking baths. I love walking. I think all these ideas of what resting could be for us and how we can reimagine ourselves to be more human is really the key to this work. To begin to disrupt the idea that you're a machine and that your worth is connected to your accomplishment."

Some countries, like France, have [laws](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/02/belgium-right-to-disconnect-from-work/) that protect the right to disconnect from work emails after hours. And several [companies](https://www.npr.org/2024/02/27/1234271434/4-day-workweek-successful-a-year-later-in-uk) around the world are testing four-day workweeks.

"The results are really stable," said sociologist [Juliet Schor](https://www.npr.org/2024/02/27/1234271434/4-day-workweek-successful-a-year-later-in-uk) of Boston College, who's part of the research team to track the four-day workweek's success. "It's not a novelty effect," she continued. "People are feeling really on top of their work with this new model."

I want to believe that's possible for me too.

Not just to rest without guilt.

But to stop thinking guilt means I'm doing something wrong.

Yesterday I took the afternoon off again.

No agenda. No errands. I just walked through town, got a sandwich, and sat by the river for a while.

There were emails I hadn't answered. Drafts I could've worked on. A dozen ways I could've used the time better, depending on how you measure it.

But I didn't do any of that.

I just sat there.

And at first, the guilt kicked in like it always does.

The voice that says I'm being lazy. That I'll regret this. And that other people are working harder, doing more, moving faster. It's automatic now. I don't even have to think the thought. My brain just fills it in. But I didn't reach for my phone. Didn't open my email app just to "check something." I stayed exactly where I was. And after a few minutes, the panic faded.

I watched people walk past. Someone was eating chips out of the paper. A kid was throwing crusts to the ducks. Two women were laughing about something I couldn't hear. No one cared that I wasn't doing anything. And the world didn't fall apart because I took an hour off.

I wondered how many years I've spent chasing productivity that didn't actually move the needle. And how many days I've filled with tasks, not because they were urgent, but because I didn't know how to be still.

I don't want to live like that anymore because I've spent years chasing progress just to prove I wasn't falling behind. But now, I'm starting to see how much that pace cost me. I missed birthdays. I skipped meals. I forgot what it felt like to wake up without a deadline.

At some point, I stopped giving myself room to breathe.

So I'm not treating rest as a reward anymore.

It's what I need to come back to myself.
